# Extract
With Mozilla, Google, and the EFF leading the push for a HTTPS only web, there is no better time than now to make the leap to using HTTPS, and Let's Encrypt is making that easier (and cheaper) than ever.

# Points
* Let's Encrypt is free, automatic, secure, transparent, open, and Cooperative[[0]](https://letsencrypt.org/about/).
* Mozilla has made the move disallow non-secure http[[1]](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/).
* Google has made a UX decision to warn users that visit non-secure http sites[[2]](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure).
* Secure HTTPS connection can prevent attacks against a sites users and also prevent them from partaking unwittingly in an attack[[3]](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2905432/wider-use-of-https-could-have-prevented-attack-against-github.html).
